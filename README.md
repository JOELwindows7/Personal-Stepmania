# Personal-Stepmania
Personal project: my Stepmania assets I had been made

The license file is not here, they are on each project files if they were applicable.
If you didn't see the LICENSE.md on a project in an asset folder that mean there are been already a license the original creator had put and would be conflict if we put it. So we don't put it unless there're relevantly agreement official from the creator and/or from the license itself (could it be Creative Common ANY-NotPutTheNDtag-NotPutTheSAtag such as Zero, NC, etc. that is permissive to anything I/we want)(could it be otherwise open source license who allows us to change in our version of fork(s)).

if one of the project become Duper Awesome and/or Crowdly Popular, that project will be moved to a new repository and the old one will be planned for deletion until the agreement from the manager or leader at the area.
So, if you see the update deletes those files, that mean it's moved not canceled. check my repositories to find the newly moved one.

Speaking the canceled one, The canceled project will be stay there and that's it. if you want to resurrect that project by forking it, betterize it, pull request to here, thank you Duper so much! but to do this, make sure you keep the old copy backup in yours, for refference. put the backup in the shareable cloud upload so people can learn history.

Songs can only be uploaded at very small size. the real pack of it will not in GitHub as it requires LFS plug-in installed in the system and only available over command line (maybe... idk!) which is Duper tedious. I want it simple man!
So they can only be there at a cloud storage at the time.

Please respect the author of the projects. some musics and sounds are not mine.
